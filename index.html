        <p><b>AltSchool ID: ALT/SOE/024/0121</b></p>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my about me page. Here you will get to know about my biography, the reason why I joined the AltSchool programme, and what I am to achieve with this skill I am learning. Hang on tight and come on this journey with me.</p>
        
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>My name is TEMITOPE EDEN PETERS and I am the first of three girls. I graduated from Adekunle Ajasin University where I studied Business Administration. I also have an MBA degree with Human Resources Management as my specialization.</p>
        
        <h2>AltSchool and Why?</h2>
        <p>I have always had a fascination with how the websites we browse every day work. How do people build these responsive websites that look and feel so seamless? How can they build these virtual realities that make life so much easier?</p>
        <p>My WHY's, coupled with the fact that my mum had an accident a few years back and could no longer do what she loved best—<b>shopping!</b>—pushed me to join AltSchool.</p>
        
        <h2>My Goal</h2>
        <p>What I intend to achieve by attending the AltSchool Frontend Engineering programme is to get a solid foundation to create a real-life virtual website where everyone can experience the thrill of a life-like shopping experience from the comfort of their homes. From having your own avatars to walking around, selecting and picking products, to interactions and checkout, just as you would if you were there physically.</p>
        
        <h2>The End?</h2>
        <p>I hope you've learned a little about me and why I'm determined to do this and be the best at it! This is all for now, but is it really the end...</p>
